\begin{enumerate}
\item Extensive review into the area of the defect, or bug, prediction including what metrics were gathered, how the prediction models were built and which ones produced the best results given what factors.
\item Own research into the prediction model building, including but not exclusive to, handling of big data, supervised, unsupervised and reinforced machine learning.
\item Acquiring and configuring the infrastructure necessary to build predictive models.
\item Designing and building prediction models for researched metrics.
\item Empirical evaluation of the model built and refinement of same.
\item Verification of the bug prediction model built using additional dataset, previously unknown to the model in order to determine the model accuracy.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{chp:intro}
\section{Research Paper Purpose}
This research paper is intended to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Explore the correlation between static code metrics and the probability of a code defect occurring
\item Explore the possibility of establishing a prediction model based on static code metrics to the probability of a code defect occurring 
\item Exploring the effects of using Microservices architecture and Continuous Deployment strategy on the established prediction model
\end{itemize}
\section{Research Paper Structure}
It is divided into 5 chapters, including the current one. Chapter \ref{chp:background-research} will discuss background for the given research as well as any previous research conducted in the same space and context. 

Chapter \ref{chp:design-and-impl} focuses on solution's architecture, discusses any predictive machine learning models used as well as delves into the solution implementation in detail. All observations made during the development and research will be the focus of chapter \ref{chp:results-and-observations}, detailing all any any results obtained.

Finally, chapter \ref{chp:conclusions-and-future-work} provides a conclusion to the paper as well as making suggestions as to what possible future research may be conducted in the same research space.
